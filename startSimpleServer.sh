# Because most web browsers refuse to load local files (e.g. textures),
# it's handy to test your WebGL by running a local server.

# Run this command in the directory containing your files:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

# For Python 3 use:
# python3 -m http.server

# Then open http://localhost:8000/<path-to-html-file>.html in your browser
